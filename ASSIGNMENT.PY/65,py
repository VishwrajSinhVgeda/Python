# 65 . How Many Basic Types of Functions Are Available in Python? 
 # Answer :

 # In Python, there are two basic types of functions:

# 1. Built-in Functions :
# These functions are already provided by Python and can be used directly without defining them.

# print()
#len()
#type()
#sum()
#input()

# 2. User-defined Functions:

# These functions are created by the user using the def keyword to perform specific tasks.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 3))   # Output: 8

# Explanation :
# Built-in functions are pre-defined in Python and can be used directly.
# User-defined functions are created by users to encapsulate code for reuse and better organization.
